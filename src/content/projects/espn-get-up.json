  "challenge": "ESPN's morning show needed a new home that better reflected its conversational format. The design team drew inspiration from beloved TV gathering places like Central Perk from 'Friends' and the diner from 'Seinfeld.'",

  "result": "Studio X launched June 9, 2025, successfully transitioning 'Get Up' to Lower Manhattan. Column-free sightlines eliminated camera obstructions that plagued the previous location.",
