  "summary": "Where 1930s Art Deco meets 40 million pixels of tomorrow. A complete reimagining of MSNBC's flagship cable news studio that honors Rockefeller Center's architectural heritage while deploying cutting-edge LED technology.",
  
  "challenge": "The design must honor 30 Rockefeller Center's Art Deco legacy while appearing thoroughly modern. A single studio must serve diverse formats: panels, single anchor, remote interviews, breaking news. 40 million pixels of LED require seamless scenic integration without visual seams or structural compromise.",
  
  "approach": "Working with Clickspring Design, Mystic translated an ambitious vision into physical reality. The design pays homage to Rockefeller Center's architectural vernacular through modern materials — deconstructed archways in light wood tones, gold accent patterns featuring repeating NBC peacock motifs, and a first-of-its-kind 30+ foot curved LED arch spanning floor-to-ceiling-to-floor.",
  
  "result": "Studio 3A relaunched September 20, 2021, serving MSNBC's full primetime lineup including 'Deadline: White House' and 'All In with Chris Hayes.' The Art Deco design creates distinctive identity in the competitive cable news landscape while AR/VR integration enables enhanced election coverage.",
