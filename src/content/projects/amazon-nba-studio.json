  "summary": "The largest high-resolution LED studio floor in America. Built for legends who'd rather show you the play than tell you about it. A two-story 'NBA House' where Hall of Famers demonstrate plays on an LED court that transforms into any arena in seconds.",
  
  "challenge": "When Amazon secured an 11-year NBA rights deal, they needed more than a studio — they needed a statement. Competing not just with ESPN and NBC, but with TNT's legendary 'Inside the NBA,' required something that would make viewers forget they were watching streaming and remember they were watching basketball.",
  
  "approach": "Working with Jack Morton Worldwide, Mystic fabricated an 'NBA House' — a two-story environment where every inch serves storytelling. The upper mezzanine hosts the main broadcast desk; the lower lounge creates casual atmosphere for postgame. At the center: a regulation LED half-court where analysts can step onto the court while surrounded by a virtual recreation of any NBA arena.",
  
  "result": "The studio launched October 24, 2025 — the first NBA regular season telecasts to air exclusively on streaming. The LED court demonstration during debut, with analysts role-playing as Knicks players to break down offensive sets, immediately showcased the studio's storytelling potential.",
