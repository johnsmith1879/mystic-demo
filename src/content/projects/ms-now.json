  "summary": "Three months. Three studios. One network rebrand. Zero compromises. When MSNBC rebranded as MS NOW and left 30 Rock, Mystic delivered a complete multi-studio broadcast facility in an impossibly compressed timeline.",
  
  "challenge": "MSNBC was forced to leave its home of nearly two decades at 30 Rock due to corporate restructuring. Simultaneously rebranding as 'MS NOW,' the network needed a facility that would maintain broadcast continuity while establishing a fresh visual identity — in three months.",
  
  "approach": "Mystic delivered complete scenic for three studios: 9A (modern/polished with LED ribbon display), 9C (urban/organic with faux brick and circular discussion table), and 9B (full LED volume for virtual production). 1,782 sq ft of LED across all studios.",
  
  "result": "MS NOW debuted November 15, 2025, exactly on schedule — a remarkable achievement given the three-month timeline. Existing shows maintained quality through the rebrand.",
