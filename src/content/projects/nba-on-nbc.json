  "challenge": "When NBC Sports secured NBA broadcast rights for 2025-26, it marked the league's return after a 22-year absence. The network needed a studio honoring that legacy while serving multiple properties — NBA, NCAA Football, NCAA Basketball, and Olympics.",
  
  "approach": "Mystic fabricated an LED-dominated architecture with four floor-to-ceiling bands, reconfigurable tracking screens, and a signature etched glass logo wall with 30 NBA team panels. The 7,000 sq ft space includes a demo half-court with floor LED and regulation hoop.",
  
  "result": "Studio 1 launched with 'NBA Showtime' in November 2025, earning positive reviews for blending nostalgia with modern production innovation.",
