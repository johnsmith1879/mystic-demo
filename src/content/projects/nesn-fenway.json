  "summary": "1,968 baseballs. 60 wooden bats. One unmistakable broadcast backdrop in America's oldest ballpark. A purpose-built broadcast home where baseball's physical heritage becomes the visual identity.",
  
  "challenge": "NESN needed to replace their temporary Jersey Street setup with a permanent broadcast studio worthy of America's oldest ballpark. New construction must complement Fenway Park's iconic 1912 character.",
  
  "approach": "Mystic created a signature 20×9 ft sculptural mural with 1,968 actual baseballs and 60 regulation wooden bats, plus a 5-foot illuminated NESN logo. Additional elements include a 19×13 ft blueprint wall featuring archival Fenway drawings and floor-to-ceiling plexiglass viewing wall for fan engagement.",
  
  "result": "The studio debuted April 15, 2022, for the Red Sox home opener. The mural wall immediately established a new visual standard for NESN coverage.",
